# Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing - EDS 223
This repository contains my assignments for [EDS 223 - Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing](https://ryoliver.github.io/EDS_223_spatial_analysis/) as part of the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/) program at UCSB.

In this course, among the topics we covered were spatial data models, vectors and rasters, geometry operations, a variety of remote sensing topics including data collection, multi band data, multispectral analysis, PCA, and electromagnetic radiation. 
We used the R packages - terra and sf.
